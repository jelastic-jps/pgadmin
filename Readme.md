## Traffic Encryption

For production mode, the installation will require a traffic encryption that can be ensured with the [Built-In SSL](https://docs.jelastic.com/built-in-ssl) certificate issued for certified load balancer which becomes an entry point of your environment. To do this add load balancer(e.g NGINX) to your environment and enable SSL.
